      <description>This is my attempt to help those that are relatively new to R with an often used always annoying function that no one ever really covers in R training courses. As the title may have subtly suggested, I am talking about sprintf(). Simply put, sprintf() returns character objects containing a formatted combination of input values. I will not go into all of the various formats that are available, however I will cover a few practical examples that are often used in our work here.</description>
